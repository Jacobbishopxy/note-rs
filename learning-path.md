# Learning Path

1. Starting by 'The Rust Programming Language', learn Rust to get a brief notion.
1. Meanwhile, take 'Rust By Example' as example extension.
1. After this, reading 'Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists' gives you practical example.
1. Meanwhile, start challenging LeetCode by handling data structure and algorithm with Rust Ownership.
1. For real world project, start 'Rust Design Patterns'.
1. For unsafe Rust, in particular after studied 'Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists' chapter 6, start reading 'The Rustonomicon'.
